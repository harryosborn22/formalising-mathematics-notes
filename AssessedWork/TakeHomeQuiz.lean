Replace each sorry with a complete Lean proof, and reupload this file by 1pm Friday October 9.

You may only use the tactics from the first two lectures (`exact`, `intro`, `apply`, `specialize`,
`have`, `suffices`, `left`, `right`, `constructor`, `rcases`, `by_contra`, `by_cases`).
Do not use other tactics or term mode (if you know what that is).
